# LinearGraphGenerator

## Description
This program creates a randomly generated linear graph, in the form y = mx + c with the following limits:
* m != 0
* x is from -5 to +5
* c is from -5 to +5

  **Currently the graphs will not zoom in correctly when using the zoom-in tool as part of the plot.show() function.**
  **I am aware of this issue and I am currently working on a solution. I have only used the library briefly and am still learning.**

## Instalation
You will need to have the following PIP packages installed:
* matplolib
* random
* numpy

Either copy and paste the code from GitHub, or download the raw file to use within the IDE of your choice.
